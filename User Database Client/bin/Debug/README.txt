Thank you for reading this
In order to use the software,please start the executable "User Database Client.exe"
Most of the application's setting are stored in the hidden file "DefaultSettings.ini"
In order to log in to the app,you must provide the following credentials:

Administrator   admin    For Administrator access
Molizo          NINTENDO For Restricted access

The app can connect to a server hosting another database and other usernames,thus appearing the line "Login type:Local" or "Login type:Server",however I have disabled this functionality in "DefaultSettings.ini" 

The settings can be modified in "DefaultSettings.ini",according to this table:

InstallID RestrictedUsername RestrictedPassword ServerIP ServerPort NetworkEnable Outbound Inbound FColor BColor debug plugins firstRun Title

InstallID - Random Number generated by the app
RestrictedUsername - Username to use when logging in locally
RestrictedPassword - Same as above,using the password
ServerIP - The IP of the server
ServerPort - The port of the server
NetworkEnable - Enable(1) or Disable(0) networking,thus disabling server login
Outbound - Enable(1) or Disable(0) outbound transfers,thus putting sort of a "Write-Protect" on the server
Inbound - Enable(1) or Disable(0) inbound transfers,thus putting sort of a "Read-Protect" on the server
FColor and BColor - Foreground and background colors to use in the console
debug - Enable(1) or Disable(0) debug settings in Administrator menu
plugins - Enable(1) or Disable(0) plugins
firstRun - Not used
Title - Starting and ending with "~",uses [ for spaces.It is shown on every screen
