# Client application details
## Usage
In order to use the software,please start the executable "User Database Client.exe".
For a local login,you must provide the following credentials:

|Username|Password|Details|
|--------|--------|-------|
|Administrator|admin|For Administrator access|
|Molizo|NINTENDO|For Restricted access|

## Technical stuff
Most of the application's settings are stored in the hidden file "DefaultSettings.ini".

The app can connect to a server hosting another database and other usernames,thus appearing the line "Login type:Local" or "Login type:Server",however I have disabled this functionality in "DefaultSettings.ini" 

The settings can be modified in "DefaultSettings.ini",according to this table:

InstallID RestrictedUsername RestrictedPassword ServerIP ServerPort NetworkEnable Outbound Inbound FColor BColor debug plugins firstRun Title

|Setting|Explanation|
|-------|-----------|
|InstallID|Random Number generated by the app|
|RestrictedUsername|Username to use when logging in locally|
|RestrictedPassword|Same as above,using the password|
|ServerIP|The IP of the server|
|ServerPort|The port of the server|
|NetworkEnable|Enable(1) or Disable(0) networking,thus disabling server login|
|Outbound|Enable(1) or Disable(0) outbound transfers,thus putting sort of a "Write-Protect" on the server|
|Inbound|Enable(1) or Disable(0) inbound transfers,thus putting sort of a "Read-Protect" on the server|
|FColor|Foreground color to use in the console|
|BColor|Background color to use in the console|
|debug|Enable(1) or Disable(0) debug settings in Administrator menu|
|plugins|Enable(1) or Disable(0) plugins|
|firstRun|Not used|

# Server application details
## Usage
In order to start the server,please open the file called "User Database Server.exe"
In order to login,please use as the username "Administrator" and "admin" as the password.
Then enter the IP address of the computer you are running it on,followed by the port.
It should start automatically,if it isn't interrupted by the Windows Firewall,in which case,allow it to go through it.
You can now stop the server by using CTRL+C
## Technical stuff
The server uses the hidden file "Login.crt" to authentificate users,however it can not be installed as a valid Windows Certificate,it has to be opened with Notepad or alternatives(like Notepad++ or Atom)

Login.crt structure - on each new row another user is represented

Username Password pID BColor FColor threshold

|Setting|Explanation|
|-------|-----------|
|Username|The user's username|
|Password|The user's password,it once used salting and SHA-256,found out it was broken sometimes|
|pID|Permission ID - If it is 0,then the user is an Administrator,if it is 1,the user is Restricted|
|BColor|The user's prefered background console color|
|FColor|The user's prefered foreground console color|
|threshold|The maximum data amount the user can add to the database,set to 0 to disable|
